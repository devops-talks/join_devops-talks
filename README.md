# DevOpsTalks

> You are our best friend forever. :heart_eyes: 

Our sole mission is to help you recognize your potential :muscle:  and purpose :musical_note:. We believe that everyone has a gift in himself or herself but are not able to see it. We will help you in every possible way. Just ask us! :heart_eyes: 

Some of our core beliefs are:
* To create a safe space for free exchange of ideas
* Reduce the time spend on searching and increase the time spend on learning, discussing and socializing
* Help people to reach their full potential
* To create a community where everyone can contribute irrespective of any factor

# How do I join?

The community is open to everyone with a demonstrated interest in collaborating on best practices.

We’re starting with a small, but growing, group of contributors to ensure a good experience. If you’d like to join, let us know, and we’ll review it as we add more members.

One possible way is to tell us through an issue [here](https://github.com/devops-talks/Join_devopstalks/issues/new). Contributing to one of our missions is the best way to express your interest. You may, also, email us or get in touch at Slack. The list is endless. :rocket: 

# Contact

One can get in touch with us by opening an issue, sending us an [email](mailto:team@devops-talks.com), joining our [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/devops-talks/shared_invite/enQtMzQ4MDkzOTU1MTg0LTdlMGJiOTFhN2VmYWZlZGUwYWE4NTY3MzRjYWY1NDVmY2RlZDBiYTA4MTdjYTg1Y2YxMWJiNjU4NTAzOGIyM2M) 

# Guidelines

The only restriction we impose is that your action or words must not hurt others. We do realize that sometimes one may get hurt unintentionally. It is important to realize that we are **one big family** and at the end of the day, our purpose boils down to making everyone happy. Let us make our Earth :earth_americas: a better place.

We are working on a lot of stuff and we will help you to find an appropriate place in one or some of them. You can start working on your idea as well under our initiative and other members will join and help you. Best of luck in improving the world.

## We are looking forward towards enjoying with you. :wine_glass: :cake: :dancer: 

> We can do it and we will do it.
